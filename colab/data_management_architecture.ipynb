    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will act as a data engineer tasked with recommending the most cost-efficient data management architecture for a company. The company generates and uses data in various ways, and the decision must be made considering only the costs of storage, data transfer, querying, maintenance/administration, and data source acquisition, along with the frequency of these operations. In this exercise, we focus only on costs.\n",
