    "### Background Story\n",
    "\n",
    "A fictional company *QuickMart* is a rapidly growing online store for electronics with thousands of products across various categories. With a vast customer base, QuickMart relies on fast and efficient product searches to keep up with users’ demands and to ensure low latencies. Every time a customer searches for an item, such as “Bluetooth Headphones,” the system needs to retrieve matching products from thousands of entries in real-time.\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity, QuickMart’s search function uses exact product names, making it critical to match customer queries to the Product Title column in the database. However, with a growing catalog, finding an exact match by sequentially scanning every product title is increasingly time-consuming. Developers from QuickMart reached out to you, since you are an expert in optimizing database accesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "1. **Naive Approach**: We are starting slowly and implementing some functions which simulates the naive approach to access the products in a database. This is how Quickmart did up to now. Since we are already familiar with _pandas_, we are using pandas as the database of our choice to apply our operations.\n",
    "2. **Quick Access using the simulation of an index**: Using the naive approach, we have gained a feeling about efficiency and up to how many requests this might scale. However, Quickmart grew rapidly in the past, therefore we need another strategy for the access into the database. Here we will simulate the index access to get an impression about what indices are capable of."
