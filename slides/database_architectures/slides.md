So is a file system all you need to store information?

What is a data base and what is it good for?

#### What is a data base?

- TODO: include img keynote

--

#### What is it good for?

- efficient <span style="color: yellow;">CRUD</span> operations
- <span style="color: yellow;">ACID</span> criteria guarantee
- storage efficiency
- scalability

How can the efficiency of **CRUD** operations be influenced?

--

TODO: explain an index

---

#### ACID

- group work: 4 groups, each one is studying one of the 4 ACID criteria, explaining it to the course and providing an example
- ACID (https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=GAe5oB742dw&ab_channel=ByteByteGo)
